This port of DND #1 is for fun, being ineligible for the for the contest because it is written in AS3.

This project is ready to run in Adobe Flashbuilder and if with a valid Apple certificate and a  provisioning
profile it can be installed on iPad.  There are two parts:

AIR-DD1-AS3 - the code
AIR-DD1-FLA - the assets including bg art, sounds, and an embedded font

The AS3 port employs a main game loop that simulates BASIC’s blocking input.  There are classes for
managing Input, Output, the Map, Monsters, Items, Inventory, Spells, and a virtual keyboard (for iPad). 


The opportunity to work with original code by Lord British is too good to pass up.  My days as a programmer
began in 1980 when I was 12.  My first language was Applesoft BASIC.  After proving my dedication to coding
on a Radio Shack Pocket Computer 1, my dad got us an Apple IIe.  I made some elaborate programs, but now that
I see what Richard Garriott produced (vi paper tape rolls!) I have a new appreciation for him.  
BTW: My boxed copy of Exodus Ultima III is still in great shape and includes the cloth map.  And I still have
the Mockingboard.
